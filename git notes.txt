1.git clone url
for downloading a folder from github


after updating a code,we need to add it to final repositaries.for that we use two commands add and commit.  

2.git add filename
this is used for tracking    
eg: git add .\filename

3.git commit
this is continuation for git add
syntax: git commit -m"first commit"

4. git status 
it is used to check the status of the current git

5. git push 
it is used to push the file into github repository

6.git pull
it is used to get the file from the github repository
we need not update any changes after pulling.
usually the code will be merged .in case if it is not merged then merge conflicts will occur,
in that cases the command prompt will show kindoff message.
so we need to do after making some changes.


7.git commit -am".............."
itt is a shortcut used to add and commit till that work that 

8.
git reset--hard commit hash
it resets to the hash value at which it is been allocated.
git reset--hard origin/master
it resets to the origin

At times liner storing of commits leads to the bugs.inorder to avoid it we use a concept called branching.

usually we call the main branch as master branch. 
9. git branch
10. git checkout-b"........."
